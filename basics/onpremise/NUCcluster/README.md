Automating private bare-metal cluster setup with Cobbler
==========================================

### Abstract

Aside from the supercomputing centers, a small private cluster up to about 10-50 cores provide sufficient amount of resources for the majority of tasks for startup-sized enterprises.
A 50-core cluster can occupy about 0.5 square meters of the desk space, consuming less than 500 watts under the load, what is comparable with a single  desktop-sized workstation.

As a buiding  block we will use Intel [NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html), a 10x10x3-5 cm box equipped with 4 CPU cores, fast SSD drive up to 2TB, and up to 32 GB RAM.

[Cobbler](http://cobbler.github.io) is a piece of software which will be used to push a life into NUC's bare-bones.

This material is intended to serve as  guidelines for deployment, including network configuration, but omitting some software installation. In the latter case we will refer reader to the corresponding tutorials.

### Materials and equipment

The  equipment for setup is the following:

 1. NUCs, [nuc7i3bnk](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc7i3bnk.html)
 2. Netgear switch, [GS108Tv2](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/GS108Tv2)
 3. MacBook with Internet enabled to make the initial kick-off

Apart  we would need some software, patience, connectors  and Ethernet wires.


Cobbler helps to   automate  OS installation (PXE-install) on either  bare-metal or virtual host, providing possibility to configure each host according to it's role in the future cluster.
Cobbler is a mature product used by supercomputer centers (i.e. [UPPMAX](uppmax.uu.se)) and currently  has the best support for CentOS.

Its key features are:

  1. integration with [DNSmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html), which is easy to configure and targeted for small networks. DNSmasq includes [TFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol)-server for delivering files during [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) booting, [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server for leasing IP addresses to the nodes, DNS-caching server for resolving names.

1.  *mirror* a full Linux repo from the Internet repository and serve the packages with package manager (`yum`, `apt`), not only speeding up the deployment and installation process, but also making things work in Internet-restricted places, like banks.

1. More fine-grained provisioning to tune up the host to it's role could be achieved by integrating with  [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), pulling and applying playbooks (`ansible-pull`)  from the GitHub, as exampled [here](https://www.stavros.io/posts/automated-large-scale-deployments-ansibles-pull-mo/)

### Steps to go

The whole process could be divided into roughly  the following  stages:


 1. [Connecting Macbook, switch and  NUC](configuring_switch.md)
 2. [Configuring NUC gateway](Configuring_NUC_gateway.md)
 3. [Installing and configuring Cobbler on the NUC gateway](installing_cobbler.md)
 4. [Provisioning NUC-worker  hosts](provisioning_nuc.md)
 5. [Postconfigure -- hiding switch behind the firewall](hiding_switch.md)
